    <h1>The Odyssey</h1>
    <p>The Odyssey is an epic poem that was originally shared orally.
      It was eventually written down and is one of the oldest works in the
      Western canon. Though it is attributed to Homer, it is unclear
      whether Homer was one person and a group of people. Most likely there is a group of people
      whose collective changes to the text over time have seperated it from any
      one of them. </p>
    <p>Odysseus fought in the Trojan war, and his journey home to Greece was plauged by many trials.
      This webpage endeavours to outline these trials to take the user through the journey home, the odyssey,
      in Odysseus' shoes</p>
