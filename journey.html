      <div id="cicones" class="step">
        <h3>The Cicones</h3>
        <p>Odysseus and his crew embark from Troy with eyes set on getting home. They are quickly diverted, however, and
        end beaching their fleet in the lands of some allies of Troy, the Ciciones. They sack the city they find there,
        and begin to load their ships with stollen wealth. Many of the troops overindulge, however, and Odysseus loses
        control of them. Soon, the Cicones and some to their allies mount a counter-attack. Quickly, the drukne Greeks are beaten
        back, and some of them are killed. The set off sailing again, tails between their legs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="lotus" class="step">
        <h3>Land of the Lotus Eaters</h3>
        <p>Worn down, the Ithican fleet sails onward towards home. Their next landing, however, poses a different sort of danger.
        The island that they arrive at is inhabited by seemingly peaceful people who welcome some of Odysseus' crew to dine with them.
        They share with these Greeks lotus flowers, and any who consume them never want to do anything aside from eating more lotus
        flowers. Odysseus drags these men back to their ships and they quickly disembark.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="cyclops" class="step">
        <h3>Polyphemus</h3>
        <p>Next, the fleet lands on an unihabited island. The crew is content to remain there to rest, but Odysseus, seeing an inhabited island in the distance,
        insists that they go and explore it. Taking a crew of the best Greeks, Odysseus lands on this island and discovers a huge cave
        that appears to be someone's home. His crew is skiddish, and insists that they leave, but Odysseus is sure that whoever lives there
        will give them gifts. He is wrong. The cave is home to an enourmous cyclops named Polyphemus who imprisons Odysseus and his crew and begins to east them
        one by one. Eventually they escape by poking out Polyphemus' eye and clinging to the bottoms of his sheep as they go out to pasture.
        As they leave, Odysseus reveals his identity to Polyphemus, who asks his father Posidon to curse Odysseus.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="wind" class="step">
        <h3>King of the Winds</h3>
        <p>Incresingly bedraggled, the group arrives in a foreign land ruled by a king who welcomes them to stay with him. He has been blessed by the Gods and, taking a liking to Odysseus,
        gives him a gift: a bag that contains all the winds. Again the crew sets out for Ithica, and Odysseus releases the prfect wind
        to speed them home. He spends days at the tiller, not sleeping, trusting no one but himself to steer them straigh.
        Eventually, Ithica in sight, he lays down to rest. His crew, suspecting that he has hidden treasure from them, open the bag,
        releasing all the winds at once and blowing the fleet hopelessly off course.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="fjord" class="step">
        <h3>The Laestygonians</h3>
        <p>Odysseus' fleet now sails totally unknown waters, totally depressed after being so close to their goal. They find a sheltered fjord and decide to lay anchor inside.
        Only Odysseus boat remains outside the fjord, suspecting something is amis. Scouts sent to explore return with stories of huge cannibal giants. Soon the fjord is surrounded by such.
        They rain down rocks and spears on the sheltered boats, and all are destroyed. Only Odysseus' ship sails away unscathed.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="circe" class="step">
        <h3>Circe</h3>
        <p>Bemoaning the death of almost 400 of their comrades, the remaining ship lands on yet another island. Terrified of what they might
        find, they do not want to explore, but Odysseus forces a group of Greeks to explore. Only one of them returns, telling of a palace deep in the
        woods. All his other comrades, he claims, were turned into pigs by a witch who lives there. Odysseus, with the help of Hermes, is able
        to outsmart the witch. Odysseus, along with his remaining crew remain with Circe for a year. Finally, they are
        restless to leave, and Circe advises that Odysseus must travel to the Underworld. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="underworld" class="step">
        <h3>The Underworld</h3>
        <p>Odysseus sails to the Underworld, where he converses with some of his dead Trojan war comrades, and recieves a prophecy from a famous prophet about
        his return home. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sirens" class="step">
        <h3>The Sirens</h3>
        <p>The crew returns to Circe's island, prepared to continue their journey home. Circe shares two things with Odysseus about the next leg of sailing.
        First the crew must pass the sirens. Circe advises Odysseus to plug his crew's ears with beeswax, so that they cannot hear the sirens enchanting song
        Odysseus himself desires to hear the sirens' song, and has his men tie him tightly to the mast as they sail by.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="monster" class="step">
        <h3>Scylla and Charybdis</h3>
        <p>The other danger that Circe warns Odysseus of is that of Scylla and Charybdis. The ship must pass through a narrow channel.
        On the right is Scylla, a 6 headed monster that will swoop down and snatch 6 of Odysseus' men as they sail by. On the left is
        Charybdis, a gigantic maw that sucks down water a few times a day, creating a massive whirlpool. Odysseus decides to sail past Scylla, and
        loses the six men to her heads.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="cattle" class="step">
        <h3>The Cattle of Helios</h3>
        <p>Past the danger of Scylla and Charybdis lies an island that holds cattle belonging to the sun god, Helios. Circe and the prophet in the underworld both warn Odysseus
        that his crew should not eat the cattle. At first this is fine, but the crew is becalmed on the island, and as supplies run out, they turn to the cattle. They eat the cattle.
        Helios is furious, and when the ship finally sets out again, it is totally destoryed in a storm. Only Odysseus survives by clining onto a piece of wood.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="whirlpool" class="step" class="leftside">
        <h3>Whirlpool</h3>
        <p>Odysseus is swept all the way back to Charybdis, who is in the process of creating a whirlpool. He narrowly escapes by clinging on to a fig tree
        that extends its branches out over the water. After the whirlpool subsides, Odysseus falls back into the water.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="calypso" class="step" class="leftside">
        <h3>Calypso</h3>
        <p>He is eventually carried to yet another island. This island is inhabited by a minor goddess named Calypso, who keeps Odysseus captive for 7 years. Eventually
        she is compelled to let him leave. She helps him build a raft and sends him on his way.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="court" class="step" class="leftside">
        <h3>Phaeacian Court</h3>
        <p>A storm comes, and destroys Odysseus' raft. He is swept to the island of the Phaeacians. They listen to his story, and carry him safely home to Ithica. </p>
